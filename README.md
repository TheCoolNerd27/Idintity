# Idintity

Wouldn’t it be so much easier if our documents could speak to us, to update us on their status or to warn us as their lifespan comes to an end? It was exactly this concept that resulted in the birth of Idintity. Extracting relevant data from the dry documentation using machine-learning software, it secures them within a protected database and brings them to life in cyberspace, acting as a personal organizer. Everything in one place, Organize your life better!
